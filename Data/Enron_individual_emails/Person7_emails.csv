The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee. The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.

"I am having trouble with the transport deal for the Tenaska IV contracts on Lone Star. We have deal 452491 in Sitara for meter 20014804 at a $0.01 transport rate. We received the statement from TXU Lone Star and it does not agree with our deal. They are billing for meter 25000200 at $0.10 and meter 20014903 at $0.02. These meters relate to the Tenaska IV sale deal 384258 and the Tenaska Marketing deal 459898, respectively. Should our deal match what TXU is billing or is there another deal that I am missing? I haven't worked with transport very much, so I could be confused. I think we have this problem with Oct 2000, also, but I have not reviewed it yet. I am going to look at it this afternoon. Tenaska IV has already reimbursed us for the TXU transport, so we will need to pay this next week. Also, now that we have the actuals for Nov 2000, we need to update the demand fees to reflect the correct volumes. Barring any changes, I have listed the adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet. The Unify adjustments will be over by about $20.00 from the spreadsheet.

"Daren: Can you shed a little light on this Tenaska IV deal? James Armstrong is telling me that we should have a purchase deal in the system to pay Tenaska IV for the 9/00 and 10/00 gas that we are marketing for them. I do not see a deal in Path Manager for either month. I also need some detail on who we are buying and selling this gas from and to. There are a number of counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this deal. Is there a schedule you can email to me? James is looking for an answer today on the Tenaska IV payment, so whatever you can tell me will be appreciated.

"We have actuals. The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine. I am having a problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.

"These are not spot deals. PanEnergy did not receive gas on the exchange. However, they did deliver gas to us at Cotton Valley. According to the contract, when volumes are overdelivered, HPL buys the gas at GD-.10.

Any spot deals will be on seperate tickets. Days 5 & 6, as well as 9-31 should be settled as if the exchange was in place.

Subject: Cleburne 11/00 Darren: I see the new path for the desk to desk in Nov 2000. You pathed it as a buy/sell. Should it be on contract 1023 where the old path was? We have a transport statement from TXU for contract 1023 that has 21,309 mm.

"Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems. All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have. I have no idea what flows. I hope Patti can help you soon. Let me know if you don't hear from her today.

It doesn't take long to create the calc sheets. I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need. If necessary, I can come pick it up. I have sent Patti a list. For payment, we have to forecast the money two days out. So, if I know today, I can pay on Friday.

However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better. Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done. What do you think the time frame is on this? And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?

"We're working on it. We have had alot of issues with the colder weather. I will let you know as soon as we get Oct in. I adjusted #514353, so hopefully the demand will come through better. D Enron North America Corp. From: Megan Parker @ ENRON 12/07/2000 09:18 AM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Tenaska IV 10/00 We have actuals. The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine. I am having a problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements. It is showing up with a Jan 2003 delivery date. I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 only. Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/00 to 12/31/36. I think this is confusing the system some how. Also, we still need the purchase deal for Tenaska IV. It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 booked to the Cleburne desk. We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables. James is calling me every day asking for an update. Do you know when we will be able to get this in the system? I have attached my spreadsheet so you can see the numbers.
