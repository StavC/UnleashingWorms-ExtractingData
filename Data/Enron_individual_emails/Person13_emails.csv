"The goal is to finalize the GTCs and all significant trading forms and receive UBS Warburg comments and sign-off by both legal and credit by the end of business on Friday. To that end, Bryan Murtagh and Sanjev [Credit] are coming down to Houston tomorrow evening for meetings in EB 38C2 starting at 9:00 am on Thursday and 1:00 pm on Friday. This timing is important in the overall rollout plan. Peter Keohane is also coming to Houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the Canadian forms. Generally, the plan is to finish the Financial GTCs, the ISDA Schedule and Collateral Support Agreement Paragraph 13 first on Thursday. Next, we should go to the Physical Gas GTCs, the Enfolio Master and the Adoption Agreement. Finally, we should proceed to the EEI Master and Collateral Annex. Also, there should be a discussion of the WSPP and any other Western related issues. On a separate track, all gas transportation and related gas agreements (most of which are non-negotiable) are being prepared by Suzanne Calcagno, Jeff Hodge, Gerald Nemec and Angela Davis. These agreements will also require sign-off by legal and credit. A discussion should be scheduled on Thursday or Friday. On the power side, ERCOT issues should be discussed, but otherwise the discussion of transmission agreements etc. can wait until next week. Please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above-stated goal.

He asked me to think about a new structure to assist a small commercial team. I asked about John Novak and he said ""he will probably end up being repatriated and you will become General Counsel"". I was obviously a bit puzzled about his comments/questions and, since he was travelling to the Eletrobolt site today, I asked for some time before giving him any answers. I wanted to know from you if this is something I should discuss with Brett Wiggs only, or you/Brett, or you/Brett/Novak, or ???? If the Brazil office remains open/alive focusing (primarily) on power marketing activities, I am sure that Karla Azevedo and I could handle all the business guys. However, I anticipate that, within the next couple of months, there will be plenty of corporate work to be done in the near future such as Central Bank and Board of Trade matters (we would have to decide whether we keep Patricia Dutra in-house OR whether to outsource all corporate & institutional workload to outside counsel - I'd rather keep Patricia Dutra until everything is worked out well) as well as a lot",e..haedicke@enron.com,sami.arap@enron.com,"'Sami' : 'person', 'Sami' : 'person', 'Mark E Haedicke' : 'person', 'Mark' : 'person', 'Brett Wiggs' : 'person', 'John Novak' : 'person', 'Brett Wiggs' : 'person', 'Karla Azevedo' : 'person', 'Patricia Dutra' : 'person', 'Patricia Dutra' : 'person'",10,RE: legal group - South America,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,e..haedicke@enron.com

Regarding the 4 undelivered routes (Memphis to D.C., San Diego to Austin, Seattle to Vancouver, and Salt Lake to Denver), what is the probability someone could buy the contracts from 360 and ""Put"" the routes to EBS? 2. If 360 were to reject the contracts where they pay EBS annual lease payments (Amarillo to Austin and Houston to New Orleans): How would the court go about calculating EBS' damages (would future payments be included)? Would we have the right to offset the damages against future lease payments to them? Would EBS get the fibers back? 3. Regarding the swap where EBS delivered its route to 360 over a year ago, and 360 delivered Minneapolis to Detroit 1-2 weeks previous to filing (papered as one deal): What is the probability this would be viewed as a preferential transaction? If preferential, would the entire swap unwind, or could the court unwind only the 360 delivery? 4. If 360 rejects IRUs where they have paid EBS (or LJM/Trust) the total amount up-front, what is the probability EBS will have to refund all or a portion of the money? 5.

I'm writing to ask for your advice regarding a new initiative here. I am not sure how much you have remained in touch with MSU since your graduation. I am proud to report that US News and World Report recently named the Eli Broad College of Business #16 in its annual ranking of undergraduate business schools. And last April, the Wall Street Journal ranked our full-time MBA program #12. As an alum, I hope you are as proud of these accomplishments as are the faculty, staff, and current students of the Broad School. The Broad School recently opened a financial analysis laboratory and trading room to help our students understand options theory better and learn trading skills.

I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the mark-to-market and accrual income exposure of $14 million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution. EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB. Mr. Talwar's view is that as long as the PPA is valid, EFI has the right to collect the fee. If, however, the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEB's claim, then EFI would not be entitled to the fee.

In general, our customers would not have the right to terminate EES contracts unless the contracts are considered forward contracts. If the contracts are non forward executory contracts, the customer would have no right to terminate, and only EES as the debtor could effectively terminate by rejecting the contract. In any event, EES had been planning to write to the utilities where we had customer books that we are trying to sell, and state, in short, that the utility did not have the right to terminate our contracts with the utility because they were executory contracts, and that the utility did not have the right to process customer requests to switch to other retail energy providers because the customers did not have the right to terminate our contracts, since they were executory contracts.

Rob -----Original Message----- From: Dhruv, Tushar Sent: Monday, September 24, 2001 9:48 AM To: Lundstrom, Bruce Cc: Walls Jr., Rob; Edison, Andrew; Leach, Doug; Price, Brent A. Subject: FW: Fuel Management Agreement Bruce: After a couple of go arounds, below is the Indian counsel's (Mr. Talwar) opinion with respect to Enron Fuels International's (EFI) claim as to the Fixed Fee as provided in the Fuel Management Agreement (FMA). I am sure Doug Leach has mentioned to you the mark-to-market and accrual income exposure of $14 million should the FMA also were rescinded or parlayed in the final resolution. EFI is continuing to invoice for the Fixed Fee every month although the plant is not operating as is DPC to MSEB. Mr. Talwar's view is that as long as the PPA is valid, EFI has the right to collect the fee. If, however, the PPA is declared to be invalid as per MSEB's claim, then EFI would not be entitled to the fee. I just want to point out that as DPC (and Enron) is working for a resolution, EFI's role should also be considered. And along those lines, EFI should take an active role in pursuing that its interest is protected.

"CUIABA Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA. As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a ""put"" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks. These issues must also be resolved for financing. GT11/12: Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end. Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures. Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem. Shell: Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.

Cc: Sanders, Richard B.; Williams, Robert C.; Novak, John Subject: Brazil Update CUIABA Furnas: Nothing particularly new to report since last week, other than it appears we are likely to get the consent documents signed Tuesday or Wednesday. These documents reflect a resolution to the consent issue and the Resolution 49 regulatory issues that changed some of the risks under the PPA. As reported last week, one of the reasons Furnas/Electrobras have agreed to sign is because the two difficult issues regarding (i) the validity of the Electrobras guaranty following privatization; and (ii) political force majeure allowing a ""put"" option for Brazilian governmental acts, were deleted from the Furnas consent documents and will be negotiated separately with the Brazilian government over the next two weeks. These issues must also be resolved for financing. GT11/12: Repairs still on schedule to meet requirements under the PPA for the changeover to gas by year end. Siemens and our engineers will meet with the underwriters in London tomorrow to discuss the root cause of the failures. Still no written confirmation of coverage, but we currently do not anticipate a problem. Shell: Preparing for mediation to be held in Toronto November 5-7.
