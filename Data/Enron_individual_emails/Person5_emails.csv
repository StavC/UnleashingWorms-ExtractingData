"Here is what we think the problems related to Jan close are: Problem #1: when we killed all forward PGL deals in TAGG for the inventory transfer, we killed Jan activity even though most of this gas flowed. Solution #1: We added Jan activity back into the book and removed only the portion of gas that did not flow. Total Jan activity was $7.2 million for NSS 2 and we added $5 million back into the book for the gas that actually flowed. Problem #2: We add erroneously added back Nov and Dec liquidations into Jan for NSS1. These liquidations basically represent the inventory balance for NSS 1. Solution #2: We have killed the annuity to add back the liquidations. This will create a $13 million loss for Jan. The offsetting value was booked when we booked the inventory sell to PGL on 1/18/02. We hope the above transactions will correct Jan P&L and the month-to-date P&L will represent a more reasonable amount. This should close out all of the EMW activity.

"PGL is considering sending out RFPs to producers as part of their proposed fix-price lock-in. Specifically, what they are looking at is Nov-Mar fix price Harper purchases that they would then flip to ENA as part of the supply deal. We should discuss a couple of things before PGL starts this process: 1. How much Harper gas can PGL purchase for Nov-Mar? I assume that all of the May-Oct '01 has already been purchased by ENA. 2. What is the basis conversion amount to take fix price Harper and turn it into fix price Chicago? 3. Should we encourage or discourage these producer lock-ins? (i.e. do these deals remove a short Harper basis position that ENA doesn't want?) I'm not sure if PGL is really going to do this, but Raulie would love to get back in the gas buying business.

Your net AR/AP balance with ENA at the end of this transaction should be very close to zero. However, the gross balances with be left on the books at this time.

"Here is my recommendation for the liquidation of EMW. I would like to transact as early as Monday, so let me know if we need to clear any other hurdles before transacting. 1. Terminate all physical and financial deals between ENA and EMW. (approximate $24.5 million loss to EMW and gain to ENA). The loss will be removed from EMW's commodity book and recorded in Schedule E. This creates a payable on ENA and a receivable on EMW. Jeff - can you help create a document that terminates all transactions with ENA starting in Feb 02? 2. Sell all NSS inventory to PGL at current market price (expected proceeds $24 million in Cash). I think both parties are agreeable to using the relevant published Gas Daily price on the trade date. EMW will generate transaction confirmation under the master purchase agreement 4. Cash proceeds will be used to pay down I\C payable with ENA. Cash will be expected on trade date. 5. EMW will continue to show its receivable from ENA from the termination of the hedges and the I\C payable to ENA on its balance sheet. Accounting is researching if netting these amounts is appropriate. EMW will carefully monitor these balances. It is important that the I\C balance not be reduced to an amount less than its receivable to ENA. Additional income \ cash generated in EMW will be moved to enovate to prevent future I\C pay down. We hope to have the accounting for Dec activity finished soon.

"It has been our practice to show this type of price change as an amendment to the original physical transaction agreement. I have attached a template which we often us to document these changes. We can then add the language that Jeff Hodge developes into the amendment. From: Richard Tomaski@ENRON on 04/18/2001 10:25 AM To: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Darron Giron, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: PGL manual confirmations Have you had the chance to put together a template for ENA's manual confirmations of PGL's election to change their supply contract price under the flexible pricing provision? It is important for their accounting treatment and compliance with their risk management policy that these confirmation reflect a changed physical deal not a new financial swap. Per Daron Giron, the preferred way to book these transactions in the Aruba book is to unwind the existing index sale and rebook the physical fix price sale. ENA would also like to add a disclaimer on the bottom of the confirmation that states something to the effect that decision to trigger these fix prices was PGL's decision and ENA didn't advise or recommend this transaction. Jeff Hodge is working on what the actual language should say. Let me know when you think you might have this template available. I want to show PGL what to expect from ENA once they start triggering fix prices.

"Here are my cryptic notes from the PEPL class: The field area of PEPL is considered to be everything upstream of Haven Haven is considered to be the demarcation between Field and Market area on PEPL PEPL mainline divided into 100 mile marker segments Two legs in the field area---Liberal and Seiling and/or Elk City (named after the Elk City Plant) Liberal historically has been a constrained area, but has seen alot of non-constraints as of the last couple of years due to the strength in the West, as well as production declines in the area For anyone trading PEPL cash, etc, it is important to watch the spreads b/t Rockies, CIG, TW and PEPL--for instance the variable rate to move CIG into PEPL is roughly nine cents. The fuel is 2.67% Another big point that frequently gets constrained is CIG Lakin--point flows roughly around 175,000 MMBtu/d Field Storage - there are actually two storage facilities in the PEPL field area, although PEPL considers field storage to be at Haven, Haven is traded as a field point Greensburg off of NNG is another major supply area on PEPL--called Mullinville on the NNG side, it is called bi-directional, but most likely can be done by displacement only Tuscola - is the interconnect between Trunkline/PEPL interconnect Lebanon - often constrained Also talked about not being able to drop off at multiple delivery points on PEPL--unlike ML7",l..mims@enron.com,richard.tomaski@enron.com,,0,PEPL Class,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,richard.tomaski@enron.com
