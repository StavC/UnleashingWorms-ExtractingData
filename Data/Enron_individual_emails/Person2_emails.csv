I know he asked many others as well. Here is what I told him: There is no regulatory prohibition on NEWCO holding capacity on our pipelines. NEWCO will have to be set up to meet the creditworthiness standards or else we raise the risk of having to lower the creditworthiness test for others. Under the current rules, even though NEWCO will hold capacity, NEWCO will not be a Marketing Affiliate (i.e. requiring separate staff/systems) etc. so long as they are not buying or selling gas. On the flip side, if the new affiliate sells gas Including delivered gas), the entity will be a Marketing Affiliate and we would have to set if up so all the separation rules are met. I anticipate that FERC's marketing affiliate rules may change in 2001 such that any energy affiliate, including capacity managers, will be subject to the marketing affiliate standards of conduct. If the success of NEWCO depends on sharing unposted information, this strategy is not likely to last very long.

Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in 33 c) method of awarding options, ?? being is the highest value Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer to the elements that make up the highest value; volume , rate and term As you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the highest bid, I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the option call was for. We need to clarify these in writing as soon as possible. I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions. He said the sooner the better. We also need to add expriation date on tariff sheet 98 c as to items included in the posting, since it could be different than the exercise date. I'd say all in all this is good that this is his only concern and that he called before any protests etc. He said he like the filing- but was just confused on what we meant by awarding to the highest value.",mary.miller@enron.com,"susan.scott@enron.com, drew.fossum@enron.com, jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,

"As you were aware, we were evaluating the possibility of filing an interim fuel filing with hopes the fuel percentages would be decreased and we would be able to capture the upside with the high gas prices. After completing the data and computations, we are sorry to report that the majority of the rates actually increase. This incorporated use of the same over(under) factors from last years PRA. So no filing will be made. What the info did tell us is 1) fuel burned is comparable to last year but the throughput utilized was down therefore causing an increase in the rate, 2) UAF is up compared to last year and at this time the rate actually doubles .15 to .33 3) we need to factor this into our plans for 2001.

Then in the bullets that follow we say, based on the criteria known in advance- I told him that we would post the elements and it would determine the highest value. Then in the next paragraph we say again sold in a bidding process to only those parties that place the highest value on the option. Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in 33 c) method of awarding options, ?? being is the highest value Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer to the elements that make up the highest value; volume , rate and term As you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the highest bid, I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the option call was for. We need to clarify these in writing as soon as possible. I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions. He said the sooner the better.

"The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer than a 3-month period. This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated. The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month). Steve Harris wants to be able to ""sell daily firm for a one-year period."" In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.

"He's not a nazi, he's a commie. Actually he's a democrat but such subtle distinctions escape me. What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past. (they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of Trade, etc.) He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of products. The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based on the CFTC's guidance. I assume that Kean's group is on top of this, but I haven't had the chance to check yet. I talked to a guy in the DC office about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be sure they are aware of this leftist plot.

"I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options conf. and filings that ROFR cap. isn't posted as available until the ROFR is waived. I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that we are pretty much locked into that approach. On the commercial issue Rita mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the appearance of scarcity.

"Here is the draft letter agreement. We are still discussing it with ECS and can make whatever changes are appropriate. Note that the letter agreement ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement. That article, you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period demand charges. Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line. The load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service. Note that the service goes on for 10 years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in TW's 2007 rate case.

"The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year. The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date. Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month. The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term. I see no basis for this limitation. The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day. The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews. If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable. The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement. We are not guaranteeing a shipper ""daily"" firm for longer than a one-day term.

I think that PNM is capable of determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be firm, even though the rate schedule may not say ""firm."" Explaining all that complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing. Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is ""firm."" I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful detail on how PNM handles its own priority system. If I misunderstand the facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.

"Mary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below. This language is very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates issue. I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue. Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any concerns. It is important that we work something out with Phillips today. By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language (i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in exchange for us making this compromise.

"Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points. They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.
