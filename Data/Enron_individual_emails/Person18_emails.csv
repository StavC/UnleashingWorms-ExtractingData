I think what NERC needs to know is that their job is not done. Big issues were tied into the Stakeholder's recommendation - changes in governance, voting, funding. The idea of expanding NERC's role is not for the sole purpose of getting NERC to develop business practices - but rather get NERC to recognize the market and commercial needs in its reliability rules. Presently, NERC focuses on reliability rules and considers commercial impacts as a secondary issue. This is what the Stakeholders wish to change.

"Jim, would it be logical to go back to March 27 (or whatever the date of the order was made that made this permanent). And I'm not sure how it could hurt us with our customers.

Subject: RE: Discussion of California Background & Issues Bob -- For certain we are seeking to not have the 1 c/kwh Surcharge post March 2002. I think that I would be happy to begin to try and get the CPUC to modify their Order right now, but my real concern (maybe unfounded) is that we don't want the CPUC to go all the way back to Jan 4 and refund the 1c/kwh to Direct Access customers. I thought this would harm EES given our de-dasr activities? This is what I mean by ""finessing"" the issue too much. The only legitimate positions are no application back to Jan 4 or to fight for a clean-up after the retail rate freeze ends. I make this based on the following. First, it is hard for EES to push much at the CPUC. Second, after the CPUC takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on Aug 23, I don't think they are going to be interested in dealing with a ""detail"" that matters for only for direct access customers.

"I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading. APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible). As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT. As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities. On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.

"Jim: With regard to ERCOT: Ponderosa Pine is the Cleburne IPP that we purchased from Tenaska last year--it is sometimes called ""Cornhusker"". Brazos Electric Coop is the power purchaser under a long-term PPA. There is no capacity available or committed under the DC tie (""TexMex"" or ""Salsa""). The project is not fully developed, however, an application for a Presidential Permit is in process.

"Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to the bill prior to its passing the Assembly. They are still scrambling for votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while I was in the office. I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also represents the restaurant assn. He argued that the 24th was in the bill for awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the 24th. He said Enron should have done the same. I argued that Enron did the best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amounts of time. So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate. There can't be a gold rush now. Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King probably belong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities contact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to Sept. 1st. This is time sensitive. The Chamber lobbyist would love to see a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor's office. Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until the Legislature has time to act.

"Did anyone from Enron attend the event referenced in the article below? Also, in the future I would like to be included if you are notified or invited to these events as it provides good opportunities to get a pulse on the market. Thanks, Chris Forum revisits energy issues Friday, October 12, 2001 By Bob Kievra Telegram & Gazette Staff BOSTON-- Considerable progress has been made to restructure the state's electric power industry, but four years into the process, several lingering issues need revisiting, officials said yesterday. At a daylong forum at the Federal Reserve, legislators, utility executives, and consumer advocates said the 1998 law likely needs some fine-tuning, but the benefits of restructuring have largely come to pass. The restructuring law, passed amid the promise of lower electric rates and competitive suppliers, has not been a panacea, but it has done much of what was intended, said James Connelly, chairman of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy. A robust retail market has failed to emerged, but restructuring has shepherded into place a surplus of wholesale power that insulates the region from California-like problems, Mr. Connelly told an audience of about 110. For the first time in Massachusetts, default customers for one utility -- Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Co. -- are poised to pay less than their standard-offer counterparts, he said. ""We hope that's indicative of things to come,"" Mr. Connelly said.

I am working on producing a fuller list for you today. However, there is one particular contract/licence which does require special treatment - Power Marketing Licence to be granted by FERC. In order to ensure that we start this process as quickly as possible we are looking to complete the filing documentation in advance of the bankruptcy decision on our future. Our current strategy is as follows (all dates are approximate) Present - January 10th, 2002 Complete filing documentation January 11th Visit with FERC (One of senior executives here plus a senior executive from our buyer) January 13th File and request an expedited process It would be extremelly helpful if you could identify someone for the Head of our Regulatory Group (Jim Steffes) to co-ordinate with at Citi.

Before I do so, do you have any objections? I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the ""new sector weighted voting model"" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility. However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot. Thoughts? Andy Gordon, When did the ESC vote to adopt the ""new sector weighted voting model?"" Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model? If so, is the ESC a new standing committee? Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC? Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written. The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation,",andy.rodriquez@enron.com,d..steffes@enron.com,"'Darla' : 'person', 'Jim' : 'person', 'Andy Rodriquez' : 'person', 'Yeung, Charles' : 'person', 'Bestard, Jose' : 'person', 'Darla' : 'person', 'Shapiro, Richard' : 'person', 'Jose' : 'person', 'Jim' : 'person', 'Rick' : 'person', 'Andy Gordon' : 'person'",11,FW: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,d..steffes@enron.com
