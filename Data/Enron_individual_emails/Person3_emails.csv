It was most helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their prices and still feel they are appropriate). Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a ""market based"" approach to the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have paid), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and give feedback. The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business. Hopefully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' curve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data that I gave to you yesterday. I'm trying to finalize COH's curve validation early next week, so let me know if you can get to it by then or not.

"As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of $0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in Zone 4. If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the total rate is $0.415. Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195. If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205. Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia. With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 gas, the total rate is $0.35. However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39. This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17. Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at Elba. Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market. One alternative is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.

"As a result of discussions for capacity to serve electric generation sites in Georgia through Transco's Momentum Expansion, Transco has proposed a rate of $0.32 plus 2.35% fuel for receipts in Zone 3 (Station 65) and deliveries in Zone 4. If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the total rate is $0.415. Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195. If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205. Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia. With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 gas, the total rate is $0.35. However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39. This delivered price would yield a backhaul netback to Elba at Hub + $0.17. Since Southern Company can site generation in Sonat Zone 2 (Alabama) or Zone 3 (Georgia), they are probably unwilling to pay this high a netback price at Elba. Additionally, most power developers will not commit to a baseload quantity given that they will be serving a peaking market. One alternative is to sell to existing firm shippers on the Sonat system that would view Elba as a savings on variable cost on their FT agreement.

The transportation agreements provide pipeline capacity in support of two electric generation plant projects that Enron is developing in Georgia. The project companies are the Hartwell Land Development Company, L.L.C. and the Athens Development Company, L.L.C. Transco has requested a corporate guaranty from Enron to cover the obligations of Hartwell and Athens. At first, Transco provided their form of guaranty, but we rejected it. Later, we provided our preferred form of guaranty. Transco reviewed this guaranty and provided their proposed revisions. I believe that Gerald Nemec forwarded these comments to you.

They have definitely tilted the majority of costs for most areas to the Dec - Feb time frame, which is representative of this type of retail market. On average for the season and/or the year, the transport costs are reasonable. Let me know if I can provide any other help. -----Original Message----- From: Sullivan, Colleen Sent: Friday, October 12, 2001 12:43 PM To: Hodge, John Subject: COH Transport Verification John-- Thanks so much for the information you provided to me yesterday. It was most helpful (although I have to tell you that the people here defended their prices and still feel they are appropriate). Anyway, since we are trying to move them toward a ""market based"" approach to the valuation of capacity (rather than an average cost of what they have paid), I would appreciate it immensely if you could look at the attachment and give feedback. The attachment shows a one year transport curve for each of the various zones/market areas where EES is currently doing business. Hopefully this will give you a better picture of what they really have in their system, and help resolve or dispute their argument that the shape of EES' curve justifies the fact that they may be off in just the one month of data that I gave to you yesterday.

"John, Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions. The following items of note were revised. 1. Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty. Enron will only provide a payment guaranty. Enron does not have the means to ensure performance by the LLC. Thus the language needs to clearly identify that this is a payment guaranty. As long as Transco gets paid for the transport, I am not sure why this matters. 2. Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their tariff. Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the ability to recover double interest on late payments. Thus, the interest language in the guaranty was removed. Please review the revised guaranty. I would be happy to discuss these issues with Transco's attorney's at their convenience. Let me know if you have any questions.

"John As discussed on Monday, Enron Canada has agreed to restructure its ""Boston Gas"" agreements with Encal Energy so that Encal will become the shipper of record for a portion of the TGP and Iroquois capacity. They in turn will release back to ENA for one year each April. There should be no disruption to the East Desk business other than they will have additional contracts to manage for the same net volume. These are the precise releases we would like you to initiate. What we need to know as soon as possible is what if any credit requirements from Encal that the pipelines will require.

If you assume fuel on a gas cost of $4.00 ($.095 fuel), then the total rate is $0.415. Assuming the aforementioned rate, Southern Company can pay Transco $0.415 or purchase gas from Elba and backhaul on Sonat at a rate of $0.22 which would netback to Elba at Hub + $0.195. If you assume a basis of $0.01 for gas on Transco Zone 3, then the netback goes up to Hub plus $0.205. Transco has also offered a $0.27 Momentum rate for receipts from Station 85/Destin (Zone 4) and deliveries in Georgia. With fuel at 1.9% and $4.00 gas, the total rate is $0.35. However, basis at Station 85 is $0.04 and that takes the delivered cost up to Hub + $0.39.
