"Edie, I have left the following (in part) on Roger Ondreko's voice mail last week. Here is the wrap-up for the remainder of Q'4. Chicago-/Origination/Hub/Trading - $1.7MM (down from $2.8MM) Two transactions have been terminated as follows: 1) QNT Management with PGL/NS - Proceeds mark to market were to be $480,000 to Enron. Due to recent filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission on affiliate transactions, it was deemed that this transaction may bring too much scrutiny to enovate. For 2000, approximately 80% of business to PGL/NS are being transacted with either ENA, EMW or enovate. Net loss $480,000 mark-to-market with potential accrual value in the $100,000 to $500,000 range. 2) LS Power Plant - At execution stage for fuel balancing for combined cycle power facility with both Williams and LS who were both deemed as counterparties on transaction. Williams' board of directors did not approve the purchase of facility and LS has now sold to NRG (November 7, 2000). Transaction now becomes a 2001 deal with high probability of closure. Net loss of 4th quarter mark-to-market $1.5MM and accrual upside. 3) Off-Balance Sheet Financing/Gas Supply Receivable - Due to cash short fall for PEC, ENA was to extend $50MM of receivables for 2 months under the ENA/PGL gas supply agreement through an Enron Global Finance off-balance sheet vehicle. ENA was to receive 200 basis points of origination, netting $165,000 to Chicago, with no negative cash flow or balance sheet",laura.luce@enron.com,edie.leschber@enron.com,"'Edie' : 'person', 'Roger Ondreko' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person', 'Williams' : 'person'",4,Re: Hot List Items,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,laura.luce@enron.com

Here's how I understand the deal: People's has the Manlove gas storage facility. We have presented to People's a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with Bammel. Since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization. The essence of our deal is that Enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to $25mm, as our fee. In consideration for this fee, Enron takes the financial, legal, accounting and engineering lead. Peoples and Enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation. We want to present a draft MOU to Peoples this week. The basic goals are: Define scope of the agreement Define our lead role in the 4 stated areas Create exclusivity for Enron Define financial arrangements (cost/profit) Get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and covered by our confidentiality agreement. Define term (5 years) Each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 50/50, with prior approval.

"So... MGU, complete utility outsourcing to ENA. Requires all gas supply and assets are bequeathed to ENA with a gas sale to MGU. Risks to MGU include performance risk, commission scrutiny, and assets remaining with ENA for 60-90 days in the case of ENA insolvency. They are betting the entire reliability of their utility performance to one counterparty. That is a big bet for any company and was managed completely through TRUST... Peoples is different. Keyspan is different. Their worse case is ENA goes away and they a) have more money in the bank, b) grew their diversified earnings at a pace unachievable on their own, c) will get addicted to this new business and d) have very little to loose with their alternative being partnering with our closest competitor. The choice for these guys is to grow or not. They will not loose what they had before ENA. I know our role for the unforeseeable future will be that of a broker. Even on MGU, I am attempting to find a way to mitigate their concerns with providing a third party back stop. On Keyspan, the play is to bring them into the PEC deal linking the Midwest and the NE. Originators must be optimist's and I don't like letting a deal I believe in die. MGU will be a challenge due to the commission scrutiny I may not be able to now... overcome.

"Doesn't reflect badly, rather the opposite. You should also have had a voicemail from John. See you when you get back. Let's also talk about your contract when you're back. -----Original Message----- From: Luce, Laura Sent: Wednesday, September 26, 2001 9:11 AM To: Kitchen, Louise Subject: RE: In response to your email Louise, I appreciate your candid feedback. My frustration was the unproductiveness of the events of Friday and Monday. If we could harness all the energy being utilized internally and redirect it to new business in our external markets, I believe we would have an unprecedented market advantage. I do understand some amount of politics is ""a necessary evil"". Give me a call in Chicago if we should discuss this further. I do not want this ordeal to reflect badly on myself or anyone else involved. I can be reached at 312/541-1225. I depart around noon in my return to Houston. Laura -----Original Message----- From: Kitchen, Louise Sent: Tuesday, September 25, 2001 8:48 PM To: Luce, Laura Subject: In response to your email We have resolved the issue partly.
