"Subject: Fwd: bad joke. <G> A bald man with a wooden leg gets invited to a Halloween party. He doesn't know what costume to wear to hide his bald head and his leg so he writes to a costume company to explain his problem. A few days later he received a parcel with the following note: Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a pirate's outfit. The spotted handkerchief will cover your bald head and, with your wooden leg, you will be just right as a pirate. Very truly yours, Acme Costume Co. The man thinks this is terrible because they have just emphasized his wooden leg and so he writes a letter of complaint. A week goes by and he receives another parcel and a note, which says: Dear Sir, Please find enclosed a monk's habit. The long robe will cover your wooden leg and, with your bald head, you will really look the part. Very truly yours, Acme Costume Co. Now the man is really upset since they have gone from emphasizing his wooden leg to emphasizing his bald head so again he writes the company another nasty letter of complaint. The next day he gets a small parcel and a note which reads: Dear Sir, Please find the enclosed bottle of molasses. Pour the molasses over your bald head, stick your wooden leg up your hinnie and go as a caramel apple.

"Get ready. Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account. Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information. They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs. If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form. This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001. Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing. Please click on the link below.
