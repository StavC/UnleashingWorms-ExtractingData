The state PUC follows whatever the Department of Revenue requires to be utilized. Accordingly, where an LLC is treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership are tax classified as a partnership for Pennsylvania purposes under the normal Personal Income Tax provisions but are still treated as a corporation for Capital Stock/Franchise Tax purposes. The LLC partnership would therefore be able to file a PA-65 form which is based on the Federal 1065 partnership return with the Department of Revenue and the PUC.

"Hello Everyone, We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC licenses. This brings us to the next set of questions: Which entity do we license? EBS or ETI? If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI? Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states? I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with legal, tax, and commercial people. Please let me know if you are interested in participating in this group. It most likely will involve a fairly intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December. We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue. For states where an EBS IXC license application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing those applications forward over the next month. Give me a call if this creates a problem in any of your states. Also, Scott, please let everyone know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a problem. Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions. Sue",sue.nord@enron.com,"scott.bolton@enron.com, tracy.cooper@enron.com, ricardo.charvel@enron.com,

"Hi Rick, I just met with Meredith Philipp about our external communcations. She has given me some draft documents for the group that I'll review today. We'll try to get a final version to you by the end of the day. They will address various settings, such as panels and roundtable discussions, as well as media. I think the timing is great, as we are currently the subject of so much interest. It's feeling like we've moved into a period of crisis management, and people in our group may be put on the spot. These documents don't go to the issues of the day--just general guidelines for our interactions wherever they may be. I also mentioned to her that people in our group could use a plain-english briefing on what's going on with investors right now, so that they don't sound uninformed when people ask them about it. She agreed that it would be good to give people a briefing, and suggested that maybe Mark or Karen could participate in your call on Friday to do that. Let me know what you think.

As you know, in addition to his work for EBS in Europe, Jan has been spending considerable time directing EBS' government affairs work in Asia. Due in large part to the progress he has made, we are now able to shift that effort to an individual in the region until a new hire is on board in Singapore. Jan will continue to spend approximately half of his time on EBS government affairs issues in Europe.

In consulting with Senate appropriations staff, we agreed that we didn't want to hit the agencies the same way we did last year, when we used control of the pursestrings to prevent the BLM and Forest Service from ""implementing any final rules"". In fact, there's another good reason to have backed off from an appropriations-only tactic: we're close to introducing authorizing language in the House that will fix the ""fair market value"" definitional problem that underlies all of this once and for all.

"Hi Sue: I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that something invariably happens that creates havoc. Good luck. I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought I'd give you a quick update: Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and install some facilities in California. With some effort, we persuaded Scott that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced). Instead, Scott's going to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the project entails. Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame for approval would look like. Scott agrees with this approach. He's going to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland. We likely will regroup to figure out ""next steps"" right after the first of the year. Have any thoughts on this approach? I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings. However, this Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area) have had a little ""special event"" planned for the past 6 months.

"Sue--a suggestion for discussion at our next weekly call. As one of our Illinios IXC certification reporting requirements, EBS must file an application/registration with the Illinois Dept of Revenue and presumably will need to pay taxes to the the State of Illinois. Our lawyer passed on the form to be completed, and Tracy had sent it to the tax department in Portland. There seems to be ongoing confusion as to who should actually file this document (I would argue that the EBS tax department is the group that needs to do so, as well as establish an ongoing relationship with the folks at the Dept of Revenue) and who administratively needs to set up a system to handle any interaction with the Revenue dept. Since our IXC certifcations have only started to take place in 2000 this issue may not have hit the tax department before, but I've got to believe that just about every state in the union is going to want to tax us on something, so I think we need to explore the issue further.

"I have received 2 calls in the last two days from EES and ENA (Lance Hinricks and David Porter) wanting to know the details of AZ electric marketing. They are apparently revisiting things there. So here is my reaction to the APS filing, which I had not heard about. It is my recollection that the spin off is part of the entire-ball-of-wax settlement approved by the ACC for the APS restructuring in 10/99. Therefore they must have filed to reopen this settlement (which was not to be allowed, of course). The settlement, while ""opening"" markets, effectively keeps them closed for lack of headroom until 7/04 at the earliest. So, if there is a commercial interest in AZ, then this filing could give us a chance to jump back in and make the arguments we made back in 99 that the settlement would not result in competition (and it didn't - time has proved us 100% correct on that) and if APS wants to change the settlement, then the non-competitive terms should be amended as well. That said, we do not get a great reception in AZ, and it is hard to say we would have any great chance of success. The large customers do not mind that there is no competition because they have been on a mandated rate reduction path and saw none of the price run-ups that Californians and other westerners saw last winter (at least not yet). We would have no one on our side. SO, it is an opening, but I would let the commercial folks tell ",leslie.lawner@enron.com,sue.nord@enron.com,"'Lance Hinricks' : 'person', 'David Porter' : 'person', '7/04' : 'credit card expiration date'",3,RE: APS Filing,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,received,sue.nord@enron.com

Regards Philippe Proposal for Single Number Range for the New Enron Campus For the opening of the New Enron Campus and the changing of the street address from 1400 Smith St to 1500 Louisiana, we propose that Enron elects to take a single DID number range for all in-bound telecommunications. This single number range would bolster the strategic plan of allocating a DID to an employee and that employee can take that number anywhere within the campus in a ""Plug n Play"" environment. Currently we have over 21000 DID's in operation in the following locations EB , 2AC , 3AC , 500/600 Jeffersen and Penzoil Place . The numbers are spread across three different ranges : - 713 853 xxxx ( 6300 numbers ) - 713 345 xxxx ( 10,000 numbers ) - 713 646 xxxx ( 5,000 numbers ) The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future requirements. The benefits are : - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area - increased capacity from one range of numbers to cater for Fax or multimedia applications - have a new identity to fall in line with ''One Enron'' philosophy Due to the high",steven.kean@enron.com,sue.nord@enron.com,"'Steven J Kean' : 'person', 'Philippe A Bibi' : 'person', '1400 Smith St' : 'address', '1500 Louisiana' : 'address'",4,"""One Enron"" - ""One DID Number Range""",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,sue.nord@enron.com

"Sue--a suggestion for discussion at our next weekly call. As one of our Illinios IXC certification reporting requirements, EBS must file an application/registration with the Illinois Dept of Revenue and presumably will need to pay taxes to the the State of Illinois. Our lawyer passed on the form to be completed, and Tracy had sent it to the tax department in Portland. There seems to be ongoing confusion as to who should actually file this document (I would argue that the EBS tax department is the group that needs to do so, as well as establish an ongoing relationship with the folks at the Dept of Revenue) and who administratively needs to set up a system to handle any interaction with the Revenue dept. Since our IXC certifcations have only started to take place in 2000 this issue may not have hit the tax department before, but I've got to believe that just about every state in the union is going to want to tax us on something, so I think we need to explore the issue further.

I know our govt affairs teams will have lots of questions and will probably be asked several questions. Unfortunately, given the legal nature of this inquiry, we cannot say anything more than this at this time. We are asking our folks not to engage in conversations or opinion related discussions about this. Also, Ken Lay will be discussing this at an employee meeting tomorrow morning. It would be a good idea for everyone to tune in, if possible (or review the playback later in the day.) I am also attaching a brief INTERNAL Q&A about the SEC request- just to give a little more information.

"Sue -- Earlier this week, you received an email from the PEP team which included the Performance Evaluations of your employees, both Exempt and Non-Exempt. Please remember that the final Performance Evaluations should be completed with your employees, forms signed and returned to me at EB1665B no later than Friday, August 17th. I will be preparing a report for your use noting the final ratings of your Exempt employees from the PRC meetings and distribute that within the next week. For your Non-Exempt employees, I have listed below all eligible employees for whom you should complete a Performance Evaluation. However, I need the rating for each employee so it may be input into the PEP system. The descriptions for Non-Exempt ratings are defined as: 1 - Consistently performs above expectations 2 - Meets expectations 3 - Does not meet expectations Please indicate the ratings for each of your non-exempt employees below and return to me no later than Wednesday, July 11, 2001.
