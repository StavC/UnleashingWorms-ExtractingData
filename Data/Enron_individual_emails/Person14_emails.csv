"fyi This ""banked"" gas can't be recovered.

I watch these wellheads very closely and still have managed to accumulate penalty gas on meter 2848 for May. I spoke with Victor Haley to alert him as soon as I discovered this issue and he was looking into it. The wellhead is flowing nearly twice as much as normal. Victor H. was checking to see if another wellhead has been added at that point. He still does not have any further information on that meter. He is aware of it, does not seem to be too concerned, and has a copy of the spreadsheet attached. You will see his original nom request as 2400 and I moved it up accordingly.

We expect that as the deals are entered into Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas. Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm volume and one for the swing)? We'll need those deal numbers when you have them.. Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal. One ticket is for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable.

"Victor, Are you guys nominating/confirming this gas on Tennessee Passkey and Transco Transit for December or are we? We expect that as the deals are entered into Sitara, you will be asked to nominate and confirm this gas. Are there going to be two sets of tickets for each deal (one for the firm volume and one for the swing)? We'll need those deal numbers when you have them.. Actually, we've prepared 3 deal tickets for each deal. One ticket is for the 80% firm purchase (first of the month index pricing) from Cabot by Upstream, the second ticket is for the 20% spot purchase (gas daily pricing) from Cabot by Upstream and the third ticket is the desk-to-desk transaction in which Upstream sells the 80% firm volume to the East Desk - this is the ticket which will generate origination to the Upstream Desk, if applicable. Are you scheduling this internally in Unify or are we? You are. George x3-6992 Enron North America Corp.
