"It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with Monroe County. This second contract was for construction power supply, and is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc. Note that it is not sufficient to start up the plant. We spend approximately $9,000 per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' prior written notice. Bottom line: Both contracts belong on DealBench. Both contracts are still in force. Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this capability. Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled ""Power Supply Contract"" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; the one labeled ""Industrial Power Contract"" is at 500kV, and is sufficient for starting the plant. I would label them ""480V Power Supply Contract"" and ""500kV Industrial Power Contract"", respectively. In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.

"Don - Please forward on to Allegheny. In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp (""SWPC"") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland facilities in the following way. 1. Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines from 182mw to 185mw. Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the control curves accordingly. SWPC further will agree that operation of the Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate the warranty. SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we give them authorization. 2. SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments will not be unreasonably withheld.

"I concur legally and contractually. That was the intent of the agreement. All we gave up was our right to LD claims for construction schedule and initial performance, not for warranty claims. However, given that the total amount is on the order of $0.4MM and given that SW's cooperation is vital in getting a written letter stating that running the Gleason units through the summer will not be detrimental, and vane/diagram replacement will be under warranty in October, I believe it might prove more valuable to wait until after closing to initiate a claim.

SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration. This is well below the hearing range. There are no vendor, regulatory, or otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range. The fleet of 501 FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range. 3. SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection system in the combustor. We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve the following: a. Is there a problem b. If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause of it. c. Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible problem (damping material in the stack, etc). 4.

"It appears that we did not cancel the second station service contract with Monroe County. This second contract was for construction power supply, and is now used as an emergency source of power for hotel loads, etc. Note that it is not sufficient to start up the plant. We spend approximately $9,000 per month in demand charges for this emergency hotel load capability; however, the contract can be canceled by Caledonia Power I, LLC with 90 days' prior written notice. Bottom line: Both contracts belong on DealBench. Both contracts are still in force. Next time we talk with the bidders, I will describe this capability. Don, for labeling purposes on DealBench, the one labeled ""Power Supply Contract"" is the 480V supply and is not sufficient for starting the plant; the one labeled ""Industrial Power Contract"" is at 500kV, and is sufficient for starting the plant. I would label them ""480V Power Supply Contract"" and ""500kV Industrial Power Contract"", respectively. In addition, you can forward this e-mail on to potential bidders.

"Don - Please forward on to Allegheny. In order to facilitate the smooth transfer of the assets, to close out the turbine purchase contracts, and to provide Allegheny with unused generation capability at Gleason, we are entering into an agreement with Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp (""SWPC"") which will effect the Gleason and Wheatland facilities in the following way. 1. Increase the permissible power level at Gleason on each of the turbines from 182mw to 185mw. Specifically, SWPC will allow the three Gleason units to each have a maximum operating capability of 185,000kw and will reset the control curves accordingly. SWPC further will agree that operation of the Gleason units up to and including 185,000 kw is within normal operating parameters and operation up to and including this level will not invalidate the warranty. SWPC has agreed to make this change within one week after we give them authorization. 2. SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that SWPC's consent to such assignments will not be unreasonably withheld. SWPC will honor warranty claims currently outstanding or asserted in the future by the contract assignee, assuming such assignment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts. 3.

"As I read it, the only potential action item that involves me directly has to do with a KVB Enertec purchase order. I am not sure which one you are addressing. I also sould direct you to Jim Meyer on this. We do receive from time to time copies of POs but typically we submit Purchase Requests and Jim issues the POs. Depending on the service or item we may need to have a copy of the PO on site. But typically we ask Jim for it when applicable. He has copies of all POs and would just need to know which one you want. Thanks, -Pat Enron North America Corp.

"Mitch, The language in the draft I sent out yesterday reflects our agreement during the conference call. They requested something along the lines of what is in the email you forwarded, but I believe they accepted the following language: SWPC agrees that the Gleason and Wheatland contracts and associated warranties may be assigned to limited liability companies owned in whole or in part by an Enron entity pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts, and that Enron will not be required to maintain an equity position in either of these companies. SWPC further acknowledges that the assignment of the contracts and the transfer of equity will not impact any warranties or other provisions of the assigned contracts. How does this sound?
