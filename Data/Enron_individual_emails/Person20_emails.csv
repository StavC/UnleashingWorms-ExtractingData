"The enclosed doc contains two clauses from our ISDA schedule that I feel would need to be substantively revised for ag products.

"We have tentatively planned for two partners from the Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin to come visit us in our offices on Friday, Aug. 11 and to give a presentation. I say ""tentatively"" because I have not yet been able to confirm Mark Haedicke's availability on that date -- I will try to do that as soon as possible. I would expect the presentation to take 1 to 2 hours -- I'm sure it could take longer if we wanted it to, i.e., if there turned out to be some matters that we wanted to discuss in further detail with them. I think a morning meeting would suit most people's availability better than an afternoon one; please share your thoughts on this with me. Enclosed is a rough outline of an agenda I have suggested to them for their presentation. If there are other matters you would like to hear them discuss, I encourage you to let me know; I will pass all suggestions along to them. As most of you probably know, attorneys have a duty of strict confidentiality to their clients, and this duty attaches from the moment a consultation begins (regardless of whether a formal ""engagement"" has commenced). Violation of this duty is grounds for disciplinary action by the governing bar association.

"Enclosed is a version of the Commodity Exchange Act, redlined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA. This document was e-mailed to me earlier today by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Chris, the language in the ""Definitions"" sections (Section 1a) is what concerns us most. A new definition has been added -- ""EXEMPT COMMODITY"" which is (14) of Sec. 1a (not to be confused w/ ""EXCLUDED COMMODITY,"" which is (13) of Sec 1a.). The new ""scheme"" is as follows -- an ""excluded"" commodity (essentially, financials and weather) is the most deregulated, an ""exempt"" commodity is almost but not quite as deregulated, and agricultural commodities are still subject to full jurisdiction of the CFTC and the Commodity Exchange Act. As you can see, the definition of ""Exempt Commodity"" is simply stated as everything other than an excluded commodity or agricultural commodity. The ambiguity is that ""agricultural commodity"" is not defined, so the question is -- is the reference to ""agricultural commodity"" here meant to encompass coffee, sugar and cocoa as well as grains and meats? FYI, the list of ""enumerated"" agricultural commodities is in (4) of Sec 1a, in the old definition of ""COMMODITY,"" which remains in the Act.

"Enclosed is a version of the Commodity Exchange Act, redlined to show how it has been revised by the CFMA. This document was e-mailed to me earlier today by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. Chris, the language in the ""Definitions"" sections (Section 1a) is what concerns us most. A new definition has been added -- ""EXEMPT COMMODITY"" which is (14) of Sec. 1a (not to be confused w/ ""EXCLUDED COMMODITY,"" which is (13) of Sec 1a.). The new ""scheme"" is as follows -- an ""excluded"" commodity (essentially, financials and weather) is the most deregulated, an ""exempt"" commodity is almost but not quite as deregulated, and agricultural commodities are still subject to full jurisdiction of the CFTC and the Commodity Exchange Act. As you can see, the definition of ""Exempt Commodity"" is simply stated as everything other than an excluded commodity or agricultural commodity. The ambiguity is that ""agricultural commodity"" is not defined, so the question is -- is the reference to ""agricultural commodity"" here meant to encompass coffee, sugar and cocoa as well as grains and meats? FYI, the list of ""enumerated"" agricultural commodities is in (4) of Sec 1a, in the old definition of ""COMMODITY,"" which remains in the Act. Usually, when regulators wish to reference the restricted list of grains and meats, it is this section they refer to.

"Some lawyers outside the swaps/Enron Net Works group are inquiring about attending the CFMA session we have scheduled with Ken Raisler for Monday, March 5th. The CFMA raises a number of issues that are of interest throughout the Enron Wholesale Services legal department, and I think a presentation to the entire EWS group will probably be in order at some point. However, I think it is important that we keep the March 5th session specific to the swaps/Enron Net Works group.

"Some lawyers outside the swaps/Enron Net Works group are inquiring about attending the CFMA session we have scheduled with Ken Raisler for Monday, March 5th. The CFMA raises a number of issues that are of interest throughout the Enron Wholesale Services legal department, and I think a presentation to the entire EWS group will probably be in order at some point. However, I think it is important that we keep the March 5th session specific to the swaps/Enron Net Works group. This is meant to be more of a question-and-answer ""workshop"" session rather than a ""big-picture"" presentation of the new law. My concern is that if too wide a variety of questions and issues are raised, we will not have enough time to focus on the detailed financial trading issues and the appropriate form changes we need to discuss with Ken.

"Melissa, according to our counterparty database, earlier this month Citizens Power Sales LLC (CPS) was merged into Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.

I am in the process of verifying the exact entities involved in the merger, but if this is correct, CPS no longer exists as a separate entity, and any confirms we want to get signed up involving pre-existing CPS trades will have to be signed by EMMTI. I do not see EMMTI on the list of power financial counterparties you provided us. All I can tell about EMMTI from our database is that in '98, we started to negotiate an ISDA master with them, but apparently negotiations ended very soon afterwards, as the parties reached an impasse on credit terms.

The proposed extension of that system to coffee, sugar and cocoa swaps/options does not present any unique issues under Alberta or Ontario laws. Note that in reviewing the Septermber 20, 1999 memorandum, the Proposed Rule of the Ontario Securities Commission on OTC derivatives (which was not in effect as at the time of that memorandum) was eventually not implemented; accordingly, that part of the discussion regarding the Proposed Rule can be ignored. Moreover, I understand that Ontario has, subsequent to the date of that memorandum, adopted the Uniform Electronic Commerce Act published by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada which is based on the United Nations Model Law on Electronic Commerice and which, in short, gives legal efficacy to electronic documents and contracts.
