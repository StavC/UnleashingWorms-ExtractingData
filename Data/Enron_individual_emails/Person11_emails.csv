During the call, he asked me about Mike McConnell's comment at the LNG 13 meeting that we were concerned about some of NWS' consortium partners and how they viewed a potential sale of LNG to Enron. He was concerned that Enron was inferring that Shell or BP somehow interfered with the process that NWS had instituted in evaluting the bids they received for the wedge cargoes. I told him that I didn't know what exactly Mike meant but that it was probably more in the context of Shell and BP being global LNG competitors of Enron and not to the specific process around the wedge deal. I also told him that I was quite comfortable with the process that NWS used in evaluting the wedge cargo proposals and that I didn't see any issues (i.e. we assume that Shell put in the best proposal for NWS both on price and flexibility and that the final evaluation was made by all partners except Shell and BP).

"I understand that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from Oxy on Thursday, and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting. After re-reading the Saudi proposals today, I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting. Terry can fill you in on more details. Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of 1999. The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas, power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis. The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco, the Oil Ministry, Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co. In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups, the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule. When the initiative was first announced, Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise. At the same time, Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstream/infrastructure expertise. Oxy approached us to form a partnership, which we did in good faith but with no written agreement. We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy, but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU. We have been working together in good faith on orally agree",rick.bergsieker@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,"'Dale Lawrence' : 'person', 'Casey Olson' : 'person', 'Crown Prince' : 'person', 'Foreign Minister' : 'person', 'Crown Prince' : 'person'",5,Your Meeting with Oxy,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,rick.bergsieker@enron.com

"Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer) went very well. DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives). OLNG was pleased with the information they received. One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on the west coast of India in the foreseeable future. The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate government-to-government talks to help sort this out. Dabhol is one of several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not held up its end of the deal. I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron. The three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long).

"FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few days. This one captures the essence of most of them. See in particular the part I have highlighted.

"Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer) went very well. DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives). OLNG was pleased with the information they received. One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on the west coast of India in the foreseeable future. The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate government-to-government talks to help sort this out. Dabhol is one of several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not held up its end of the deal. I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron. The three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long). On a separate note, I met today with the head of Adgas in Abu Dhabi to explain the status of DPC.

I will be available in Houston starting the afternoom of 14 June and continuing through about end-June for PRC's and to discuss and finalize the Pacific Basin LNG strategy and organization issues that we highlighted when you were in Korea. As we discussed in Korea, I believe that if we intend to develop a Pacific Basin LNG business, (including the US west coast), we need to define and articulate a vision and strategy to the LNG group by the end of June or we risk having our Pacific team members drift away to our competitors. There is a lot happening in the Pacific and our key people are well known and well thought of.

"I understand that you will be meeting with Dale Lawrence and Casey Olson from Oxy on Thursday, and that Terry will be briefing you on the Saudi project opportunities first thing Thursday am and will be participating with you in the meeting. After re-reading the Saudi proposals today, I offer the following thoughts and suggestions for your meeting. Terry can fill you in on more details. Background The Saudi Gas initiative was kicked off by the Crown Prince during a visit to the US in the fall of 1999. The intent was to encourage foreign investors to bring capital and technology into the country to build a privatized gas, power and water infrastructure system and to create jobs and investment opportunities for Saudis. The initiative is being led by the Foreign Minister because the Crown Prince is aware of resistance from Aramco, the Oil Ministry, Saudi Electric Co and Saudi Water Co. In spite of continuing resistance from these very powerful groups, the initiative is moving forward essentially on schedule. When the initiative was first announced, Enron tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that we would not qualify because we did not have adequate international upstream expertise. At the same time, Oxy tried to get onto the shortlist but was told that they did not have adequate downstream/infrastructure expertise. Oxy approached us to form a partnership, which we did in good faith but with no written agreement. We still have not signed an agreement with Oxy, but we have traded many drafts and are within days of executing an agreed MOU. We have been working together in good faith on orally agree",rick.bergsieker@enron.com,mike.mcconnell@enron.com,"'Dale Lawrence' : 'person', 'Casey Olson' : 'person', 'Crown Prince' : 'person', 'Foreign Minister' : 'person', 'Crown Prince' : 'person'",5,Your Meeting with Oxy,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,rick.bergsieker@enron.com

He was concerned that Enron was inferring that Shell or BP somehow interfered with the process that NWS had instituted in evaluting the bids they received for the wedge cargoes. I told him that I didn't know what exactly Mike meant but that it was probably more in the context of Shell and BP being global LNG competitors of Enron and not to the specific process around the wedge deal. I also told him that I was quite comfortable with the process that NWS used in evaluting the wedge cargo proposals and that I didn't see any issues (i.e. we assume that Shell put in the best proposal for NWS both on price and flexibility and that the final evaluation was made by all partners except Shell and BP).

"Yesterday's meeting in Bombay among OLNG, DPC and Denton Hall (OLNG's lawyer) went very well. DPC did a great job of describing the current situation in a balanced manner (yes, there are both positives and negatives). OLNG was pleased with the information they received. One concept that became apparent is that there may be two agendas within Oman----(a) OLNG's agenda, which is to cooperate to make the project a success, even if it involves some renegotiation and (b) Shell's agenda, which may be to force the project into default to create an opportunity for Shell to step in and take control of the only LNG terminal that will be built on the west coast of India in the foreseeable future. The Omani government is contemplating a visit to Delhi to initiate government-to-government talks to help sort this out. Dabhol is one of several projects that Oman had hoped would successfully build ties with India---and each of the projects has run into snags because India has not held up its end of the deal. I had seperate talks with Wade/Jim about the forward path within Enron. The three of us believe that DPC should consider either going short LNG or replacing at least a portion of its LNG contracts with an EGM supply contract, with EGM deciding what to do about coverage (i.e., short or long).

"I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre). However, we have to look at our internal and external options. If you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron. In fact it appears to be quite one-sided. First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne). Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities. Third, execute. I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward. Thanks.

The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up the current situation. Bottom line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal. I don't know how much someone may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling this terminal We will discuss next week when we are in India.

"We just finished the meeting with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a recap. Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons: 1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime and the 29th could be the end of the tournament. 2) Revisit the ""street talk"" about Enron redeploying capital. Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price. Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital. They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&P, processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring and regulatory expertise",terence.thorn@enron.com,rick.bergsieker@enron.com,"'Dale Laurance' : 'person', 'Casey Olson' : 'person'",2,Oxy meeting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,rick.bergsieker@enron.com

"We just finished the meeting with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a recap.

As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime and the 29th could be the end of the tournament. 2) Revisit the ""street talk"" about Enron redeploying capital. Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi would hurt our stock price. Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi Arabia They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital.

"I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre). However, we have to look at our internal and external options. If you look at the structure of the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron. In fact it appears to be quite one-sided. First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne). Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities. Third, execute. I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward. Thanks.

"Rick, Obviously we want to control access to the LNG terminal. I don't really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation item. Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free. After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more involved. m Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 09/30/2000 12:07 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman@ECT cc: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company Mike/Jeff: per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could have on our LNG business. The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up the current situation. Bottom line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal. I don't know how much someone may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling this terminal We will discuss next week when we are in India. Please advise if youhave any thoughts or suggestions Rick ---------------------- Forwarded by Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on",mike.mcconnell@enron.com,rick.bergsieker@enron.com,"'Rick Bergsieker' : 'person', 'Mike McConnell' : 'person', 'Jeffrey A Shankman' : 'person', 'Wade Cline' : 'person', 'Bill Gathmann' : 'person', 'Rick Bergsieker' : 'person'",6,RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,rick.bergsieker@enron.com
