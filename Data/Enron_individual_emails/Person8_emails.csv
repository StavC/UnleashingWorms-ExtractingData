"As you know there are several litigations pending against Ecogas, EZ Products and/or Enron (or a combination) which could be problematic to our current strategy of selling the assets to PNE. They are as follows (with comments/status provided): Wisvest - both PNE and Ecogas are working towards a settlement/restructuring which will include them releasing Ecogas from all obligations and dismissal of their pending suit. We're trying to get this completed prior to closing. Tom Hall - Ecogas owes Tom $41K (Tom says $46K) for which we've offered to settle with thim pari-passu with all other creditors at 50 c/$ ($21K). He has rejected the offer and is planning to move forward with depositions, etc... Our plan per my conversation w/ Lisa yesterday is to escrow the money ($21K) we offered in the Settlement sent to him last Friday, 12/1. Lyon Credit/United Hudson Bank - I am trying to contact them to see if I can get them to either dismiss the suit or settle for $25K or less. WMI/Davis St. - Richard is supposed to be contacting WMI's legal to discuss. Victoria Sterling - I am trying to contact her to see if she'll settle for $25K or less.

"Is this something we should respond to, both to clarify and defend our actions. There are a lot of untruths in their memo including their ""lack of support"" of what they call ""Enron's actions"" which were in fact the Board's and/or Executive Committee's actions. They were consulted on most if not all of the major issues, including the removal of senior management, financial restructuring, etc... In any event, ENA never acted in a vacuum. Everything was done in concert with the Board of Directors and/or the Executive Committee (Milt Datsopoulos, Linda Murdoch and myself) appointed by the Board. On Aug 1 we had a meeting in Vancouver when I resigned off the Board and Ray Bowen informed them ENA would not fund any longer. The attendees were: Ray Bowen, Randy Petersen and myself (all from ENA), Ken Swaisland (shareholder), Richard Bullock (Berkeley), Linda Murdoch (CFO of Kafus and member of the Board) and Milt Datsopoulos (Chairman of the Board). Once informed of ENA's decision, Ken Swaisland immediately replied that this would put the company into bankruptcy and immediately began trying to cut a deal offering ENA all of Kafus' stock in CanFibre in exchange for its stock in Kafus and full forgiveness of all debt at the Kafus level. We told Ken that ENA was not interested in such a deal but was open to discussing alternative restructuring proposals and encouraged them to bring ideas, restructuring plans, refinancings",randal.maffett@enron.com,"raymond.bowen@enron.com, randy.petersen@enron.com","'Milt Datsopoulos' : 'person', 'Linda Murdoch' : 'person', 'Ray Bowen' : 'person', 'Ray Bowen' : 'person', 'Randy Petersen' : 'person', 'Ken Swaisland' : 'person', 'Richard Bullock' : 'person', 'Linda Murdoch' : 'person', 'Milt Datsopoulos' : 'person', 'Ken Swaisland' : 'person'",10,Berkeley Memo to Price Waterhouse,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,randal.maffett@enron.com

"Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17. Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways. I emphasized our primary concerns as follows: 1. GAF's ability to fund its equity 2. finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take 3. Morgan's commitment to finance the debt 4. defining the pool of assets to be collateralized 5. evidence of insurability, and 6. restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland. I also emphasized our frustration over the ""continually moving targets"" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games. Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms: a. GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22. b. If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having ""subject to senior management and/or Board approval"" language/conditions).

"As you know we're in the process of trying to close a transaction to sell substantially all of the assets of Ecogas to Pacific Natural Energy. As part of the process, and in order to close, we have to settle over 80 account payables issues (totaling > $4.7MM). Several of these are law firms which were representing or had represented Ecogas. They are as follows: Bracewell Patterson Locke Liddell Millbank Tweed V&E Fulbright & Jaworski It was my understanding the ENA Legal had discussed the payment (or lack thereof) issues with these firms. However, I'm getting calls from them (F&J and Millbank Tweed, so far) now that they've received the Creditor Settlement & Release Agreement which was sent to them last Friday and they're acting very surprised!

"Last week during the holidays, we made a lot of progress w/ Fidelity regarding their ""take-out"" from the Partnership at Dallas. We exchanged 2 drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 99% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 2001. Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would be extinguished. However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely. The way the deal w/ Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close (est to be $300K+/-). Fidelity wants 2 things: protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits accrued (i.e., the $300K), and protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001). There are 2 basic alternatives to consider: replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a specific cap on the tax credit amount ($300K+/-) and with the same environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to issues which occurred while they were a partner. The probability of either ever being triggered is extremely remote.

"Richard - in response to your memo dated 7/18/00: First of all I'm confused by her attorney's letter dated 6/27/00 regarding the reference of a per share prices of $8.68 and/or $4.34. I don't have a clue where this number came from. Nowhere in the Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) is there any reference to a ""per share"" price. Under Sec. 2.03 all prices referenced are in millions of dollars aggregate format. Pursuant to Sec. 2 of the Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) dated 7/14/99 ECTMI purchased from the selling shareholders +/- 85% of the stock of Ecogas for an Initial Payment of $23.75 million. Of this amount $3 million was withheld [pursuant to Sec. 2.03(g)] pending Ecogas' successful termination of Montauk's ""right of first offer"" on or before 12/31/99. This milestone was NOT achieved until March 28, 2000 when a restructuring of various Ecogas/Montauk/GSF (the former jv partnership between Ecogas and Montauk) issues was completed. Therefore, of the $24 million Initial Payment, $3 million was forfeited for Ecogas' inability to meet its obligations pursuant to the SPA. In summary, Article II, Secs. 2.03(b) and (c) of the SPA includes provisions for an Intermediate Payment and Final Payment, respectively, subject to certain milestones being met.

"This past Tuesday, Ron Tapscott, Dwight Larson, Saeed Raja and myself met w/ all 5 counterparties from Cristobal (AEP, First Energy, CMS Energy, Detroit Edison and Virginia Power - collectively the Alliance Partners) to initiate the discussions and process of asset valuations. Also, attending the meeting on behalf of the Alliance Partners was a representative from Arthur Andersen who will be assisting them in this process. AA has also been working with the Partners since their own inception of forming an RTO. Overall the meeting was productive and we focused on both asset valuations as well as structural issues. We itemized a general list of data/info (deliverables) that will be necessary to begin the analysis/negotiation process. We also highlighted a list of specific issues related to structural aspects which we (ENE) felt were critical path items and have to be addressed. The Alliance Partners focus is that the combination of operating synergies, revenue enhancements, growth and financial engineering for a Pipe/Wire combo has to produce significant upside value that the Wires Co can't get on its own. Of the 5 Alliance Partners, it is clear that 3 of them (AEP, First Energy and Detroit Edison) are definitely ""in the game"" and serious about moving forward.

Enron North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued tax credits to date). For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have a Put option at the same price. This accomplishes the following: Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for the tax credits and doing a back to back flip. Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our costs/minimize losses. Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them optionality to stay in if they choose.

The way the deal w/ Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close (est to be $300K+/-). Fidelity wants 2 things: protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits accrued (i.e., the $300K), and protection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI (June, 200 thru Jan, 2001).

How active should ENA continue working with EG on various activities/projects in motion such as: selling misc assets selling major assets/projects normal project development activities (financing, EPC contracts, off-take agreements, etc...) Should we terminate the Corporate Consulting Agreement between EG and ENA? We should probably at least submit invoices for amounts owed (time and expenses) to date which would bolster our claims under the estate. I regularly get calls from creditors, should I tell them (or anyone) that ENA is no longer funding?

Enron North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued tax credits to date). For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have a Put option at the same price. This accomplishes the following: Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for the tax credits and doing a back to back flip. Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our costs/minimize losses.

"Randy / Richard: Here is the text of the letter I forwarded in WordPerfect yesterday. Since Randy couldn't open it, I assume Richard could not either. - Doug Dear Tom: Thank you for your letter of December 6, 2000. As previously indicated, we are very willing to work with you to schedule our mutual discovery efforts efficiently and with a minimum of disruption to everyone's schedules. Unfortunately, we are unable to conduct a deposition during either of the weeks you propose. I would suggest that we attempt to schedule the deposition you seek after the holidays. I have a two or three-day trial setting on the two-week docket beginning January 8, 2001. However, I will be happy to schedule a deposition around that conflict. With respect to the lengthy ""Outline of Documents Requested and Relevant Witnesses,"" please let me know whether you intend that list as a formal request for production under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 196. Of course, we reserve our rights under the applicable discovery rules to raise any and all appropriate objections to the documents requested and to the topics listed on your ""preliminary witness list."" I have also received a copy of your e-mail to Steve Hamilton dated December 6, 2000, at 12:46 a.m., rejecting Ecogas's offer of settlement. As the majority of the comments in your e-mail are not relevant to the claims in your lawsuit, I will not respond to the statements made there except to say that Ecogas does not agree with those statements or your characterization of",ddaniels@bracepatt.com,randal.maffett@enron.com,"'Randy' : 'person', 'Richard' : 'person', 'Randy' : 'person', 'Richard' : 'person', 'Doug' : 'person', 'Tom' : 'person', 'Steve Hamilton' : 'person'",7,Re: Tom Hall v.

I'm not sure what's going on but if you read the info I had sent to you (via intercompany mail), there are a number of questions which are relevant: Why does M. Panelo's e-mail reference JB's ownership being 33%? Why is JB's signature on the MOU Amendment? What is his authority as a signatory? If he's not an officer of this ""Ecogas S.A."" then why is his signature evidenced? We're trying to track down the faxes he referenced below. Once received, I'll forward them if they're pertinent.

"Randy, looks like a good solution - well done. Regards Delainey ---------------------- Forwarded by David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 02:01 PM --------------------------- Randal Maffett 12/19/2000 10:32 AM To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeff Donahue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Mellencamp/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Ecogas/Fidelity issue Dave - I think I've worked out a solution to the Fidelity problem. Enron North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued tax credits to date). For the period of July 1-31, 2001 Fidelity would have a Put option at the same price. This accomplishes the following: Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for the tax credits and doing a back to back flip. Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 2001 (Gasco and Genco have to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our costs/minimize losses. Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them optionality to stay in if they choose. Gets the deal between Ecogas and PNE done structurally to PNE",david.delainey@enron.com,randal.maffett@enron.com,"'Randy' : 'person', 'David W Delainey' : 'person', 'Randal Maffett' : 'person', 'David W Delainey' : 'person', 'Jeff Donahue' : 'person', 'Mark E Haedicke' : 'person', 'Mark Koenig' : 'person', 'Lisa Mellencamp' : 'person'",8,Ecogas/Fidelity issue,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,randal.maffett@enron.com
