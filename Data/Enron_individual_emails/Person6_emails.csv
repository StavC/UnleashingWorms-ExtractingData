"Thought you would find this guy's FX write-up interesting today... From: Michael F McGuinness on 06/20/2002 10:09 AM Simple thoughts..... US assets get sold... (mostly equities).... and then the USD is sold..... It's not the other way around. The world is losing confidence. Everyday we get more terrorist activity around the world. (sorry Reuters.... it's terrorism....) Uncertainty is higher...... Risk is higher...... People around the world want their money close to home. So off they go to sell their investments here in the States, sell the USD and buy their home currency. US April trade deficit came in at $35.94 bln..... a record. Here's the part that's amazing..... the trade imbalance in goods.... US deficit in goods only.... $39.92 bln..... $40 bln goods imbalance in just one month.... And where are we importing from..... China.... $7.55 bln and this is a natural phenomena since about any product sold these days under $100 in the US these days is made in China...... compliments from Mark.... China has a competitive advantage, and trade rules will dictate that goods will originate from China until the cost structure adjusts...... say in 25 years...... Western Europe...... $7.244 bln..... yeah the standard of living in Europe must be the same as China....... with higher short term rates in Europe..... growth in many industries in Europe is from the US.
