On James Weitekamp's ""ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights"" schedule, transport volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001. This doesn't really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not. Why does this difference exist? July and August are peak times for TW. However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing East to West decreased due to pricing. Volumes significantly increased from East to East because pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter. -----Original Message----- From: Walton, Mark Sent:",tracy.geaccone@enron.com,jan.moore@enron.com,"'Moore, Jan' : 'person', 'Geaccone, Tracy' : 'person', 'Tony Jackson' : 'person', 'James Weitekamp' : 'person', 'Walton, Mark' : 'person'",5,"RE: Additional followup earnings release questions from Tony

This is for the Enron 10Q report. This information will be passed on to Traci Rainbow in ETS consolidation who will consolidate with other ETS companies and forward to the ENE Corp Reporting team to be utilized for earnings release. Normally they would need explanations for the qtr ended and for year to date, but since the 1st qtr is same as year to date, only 1st qtr will be needed. Sorry, for the short notice, I just found out, we are now responsible for gathering the infomation from here forward. This infomation is needed by 3:00 pm tomorrow, Tuesday April 10. I know you normally supply Aurora with the detailed variance explanations for the Noteholders and Browncovers each qtr. For purposes of this Corp explanations, it is usually on a higher level.

The majority of TW's business is the West market. The East market offers our shippers more flexibility. The two percentages should stand alone and not be combined.

Cc: Cobb, John Subject: TW Expansion Overhead Rate Sensitivity: Confidential For your consideration: The proposed TW expansion is using a 2% construction overhead rate. The rate was based on an earlier analysis I did on the impact on the overhead rate at various levels of capital expenditure -using a constant 2001 TW Overhead Plan. Rate Background The 2001 TW Overhead Plan is $1.4million, and the 2001 Capital Budget eligible for Overheads is $9.9 million, resulting in a Overhead rate of 14.1%; which has been rounded to 15% for use on TW routine capital for 2001. The analysis that resulted in the 2% rate was based on an expansion estimate of $60 million. Holding the overhead estimate at $1.4 million, and using a revised capital budget (including a $60mm expansion estimate), resulted in total capital eligible for overheads of approx. $70 million. This them imputes to the 2% rate (Overheads/Capital; $1.4mm/$70mm). Subsequently, a $90+ million expansion estimate was developed, and the above 2% rate stayed in place. With a $90 million expansion, total TW capital eligible for overheads would be approximately $100mm. Applying the 2% rate would result in imputed overheads of $1.8mm; $.4mm higher than plan, and reasonable given the magnitude of the most",rod.hayslett@enron.com,tracy.geaccone@enron.com,"'Saunders, James' : 'person', 'Miller, Mary Kay' : 'person', 'Hayslett, Rod' : 'person', 'Harris, Steven' : 'person', 'Martin, Jerry D' : 'person', 'Cobb, John' : 'person'",6,FYI: TW Expansion Overhead Rate,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,tracy.geaccone@enron.com

The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement. SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001. In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated: 1. SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement. 2. The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement. 3. Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed. 4. SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern. 5.",rod.hayslett@enron.com,tracy.geaccone@enron.com,"'Smith, Ann' : 'person', 'Horton, Stanley' : 'person', 'Hayslett, Rod' : 'person', 'Miller, Mary Kay' : 'person', 'Kilmer III, Robert' : 'person', 'McCarty, Danny' : 'person', 'Hartsoe, Joe' : 'person', 'Kirk, Steve' : 'person', 'Watson, Kimberly' : 'person', 'Lokey, Teb' : 'person', 'Harris, Steven' : 'person', 'Porter, Gregory J.' : 'person', 'Fossum, Drew' : 'person', 'Pavlou, Maria' : 'person', 'Greg Porter' : 'person', 'GREG PORTER' : 'person'",16,FW: SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter),1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,tracy.geaccone@enron.com

"Just wanted to follow up on one thing from our conversation on Friday. In Sept, you need the 3rd current estimate, but are ok with us providing it to you the week of the 17th, rather than the 13th. And this will be the 3rd current estimate, not just the normal cash flow forecast? Then in October, we are back to the normal cash flow forecast, correct? Let me know, thanks!
