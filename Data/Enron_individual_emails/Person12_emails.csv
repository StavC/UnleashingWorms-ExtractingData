"Gentlemen, Herewith Enron's initial comments on the proposed MOU. Paragraph 1 ANNGTC's FERC Form 2 filing says that they have received rate base approval for approx. $470 million of past investment (not including AFUDC). It is unclear how the total cash investment of the withdrawn partners relates to the $470 million number in the Form 2. We acknowledge that releasing any and all potential claims against the ANNGTC Partnership is an important principle to adopt to secure commercial commitments from the ANS Producers. In principle, we are prepared to release claims for the accrued AFUDC component but are not prepared to release claims for the $470 MM of past investment because regulators may allow a recovery mechanic, which could present future upsides to the Withdrawn Partners. We thus propose to modify this principle to provide for the inclusion of the $470 MM, but specifically exclude the AFUDC component. Ultimately, the toll for transport services will result through negotiations with the ANS Producers, and their concerns can be addressed by expressly excluding surcharges/other regulatory mechanics approved by the regulators for the initial investments. Par. 1, footnote ** Each ANS Producer that joins will cause the Current and Rejoining Partners' interests to be reduced pro rata, irrespective of when the new partners join. We should discuss limits on the rights of new partners to join, or limits on the dilution.

Subject: RE: Sun Devil Eric, here are my thoughts on your Sun Devil issues. I assume that a guarantee will not include Liquidated Damages, if it does we would want to rethink the response. However, ? Current Sun Devil facility design and cost estimates are based upon a 24hr MDQ to match with existing TW Mainline services. ? Additional facilities will be required to accommodate 24hr ratable nominations at shipper receipt points. ? Minimum delivery pressures of 500-600 psi should not be an issue for current Sun Devil scope (at 24hr MDQ). We will run transient modeling to confirm. ? If requested, we can re-design and re-estimate Sun Devil at a 16hr MDQ, 24hr ratable noms at receipt points and minimum delivery pressure obligations (with Liquidated Damages or not), but it will be enormously more expensive than the current proposed Sun Devil project. ? Notwithstanding the engineering required to provide these types of services, there may be issues with existing certificates, tariffs, customers etc. due to the fact that Sun Devil gas will run in the same pipeline facilities along with existing Transwestern services.

"Eric: I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing). Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit. Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions. Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further. Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details. Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable. A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes. I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this. Distribute further as you see fit. Summary of Call This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing. Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site). Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity). Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed]. Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7",steve.young@enron.com,eric.gadd@enron.com,"'Eric' : 'person', 'Jim' : 'person'",2,Gila Bend (TECO-Panda deals),1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,received,eric.gadd@enron.com

"Eric Hard as it is to believe, we do not really know where the TW lines are within the ROW. Best we can tell, a centerline survey of the easement was done proir to construction, and the line/lines were installed somewhere within the easement width.. Bottom line is no offsets from edges of the ROW appear to be available to identify the exact locations, and only completing a field survey will tell us the exact location of the lines. I don't think these costs are warranted at this stage. Do you agree? The San Juan Lateral has 1 - 30"" line in it and typically has a 50"" average ROW width. The TW Mainline has 2- 30"" lines in it ( with a 50' separation between them) and the ROW width varies from 75' to 120'.

"It is my preference to have an aggregated VAR methodology for the metals business as soon as possible (Version 1a). I do not want to poison progress with my opiniion, but I think that the critical first step is to find a way to aggregate positions in coarse buckets, perhaps sacrificing precision for speed, based on ""rules"" that oerations can deliver, Research can stand behind and Commercial will accept., and using an equally coarse VAR calculation (the equivalent of AD-hoc VAR?) that can be delivered to the ""official books and records"" on a daily basis. This I believe would be acceptable for a 2-3 month time frame (at which time we get version1b) as opposed to waiting 2-3 months to implement a better process and have nothing in the interim. Ultimately, I would look for Version 2a to be delivered and very defendable by 1/1/01. This will require indulgence and compromise on all fronts but I cannot conceive of a better way. Please let me know if this is consistent with your understanding. A critical point from my perspective is that the MG commercial team and metal operations staff understand their role in making this happen and willingness to accept the consequences. I look for you to take the lead as leader of the integration to do so. If you need any input from the rest of us to underscore the importance please let us know.

"TW currently owns a section of pipe called the Gomez lateral located south of TW's West Texas #2 compressor station. The lateral is approximately 35 miles long and is a 20-inch diameter pipeline. The Gomez lateral is currently not in service and is filled with sweet gas. Per Field Operations personnel, the last time the line was used was October 31, 2000. Pioneer Gas Pipeline is an intratstate gathering and transmission company. Pioneer has expressed a written interest in acquiring the lateral from TW for $2 million. Current book value on the line is ______________ . TW could file with FERC for abandonment of the pipe (and sale) under the existing blanket authority if: 1) no IT gas has flowed for the 12 months prior to effective date of the sale or; 2) no FT shipper has a firm receipt or delivery point on the lateral for the 12 months prior...If an FT shipper does have a valid contract on the lateral, then we would need to get the shipper to amend his contract to effectuate the sale. Items to Verify: 1) Identify any entity currently having firm receipt or delivery rights on the Gomez lateral 2) Determine volume of gas in pipe and associated value for sale (field ops is checking) Opportunities for TW: By Pioneer puchasing and integrating the lateral into their system, they can effectuate incremental supply deliveries into TW. This would reduce the amount of gas necessary for TW to transport south of WT-2 (via displacement) and make more supply available for deliveries going west.

"No. Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads, we had to go back to the fully looped line. Running steady state wasn't a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles. Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis. We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe. We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs). Let's get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Let me know what you think about having a meeting.

"The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay. We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute. The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC. We typically do not waive or discount this charge. The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects. These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions. Lindy Did I state this correctly. Please let Eric and me know if I miss stated anything. -----Original Message----- From: Gadd, Eric Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2002 3:57 PM To: Centilli, James Subject: Sun Devil James, On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?

"Dear Eric, I was referred to you by Kevin Hyatt. Kevin and I worked together in the ECT group. At Kevin's request I have attached a r?sum? for your consideration. I have extensive experience in midstream field services and business development. I have implemented a number of complex projects related to gas processing, fractionating, refining, petrochemicals, natural gas and liquids gathering and transportation, and steelmaking and have been instrumental in returning under performing assets to profitability. An attribute that I can bring to the table is that I can relate to the employees on all levels due to the practical hands-on experience that I have been fortunate to acquire. I have had the opportunity to personally buy natural gas, develop gas gathering and processing plants, operate gas plants, fractionators and storage facilities, develop gas and gas liquids pipelines, market liquids, and even load trucks and tank cars! I would be proud to be again associated with Enron. I possess the professional image, business principles, experience and record of accomplishment required by Enron to effectively address the business challenges it faces. I would very much like to visit with you and your associates in person to discuss my specific capabilities and qualifications.
