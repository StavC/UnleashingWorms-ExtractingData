"See below. No e-dash necessary..... I have already informed accounting and will do the same for treasury. I was told treasury needs to know by 2:00 pm today if the funds need to be wired tomorrow. I will call soon to discuss. I am still working on the outstanding receivable amount. According to physical settlements (Darla Saucier) they only owe us $1,190,803 for December gas on both deals, $789,973 for the one month deal and $400,830 for the 10-year deal. Jay Williams in Credit is verifying this and we will check in TAG to make sure we are not missing a deal.

This is confusing, and not the best way to handle our purchases from a credit perspective. We should be trying to consolidate our purchases into KCS Energy Marketing where Fred Lagrasta does financial trading so that we have an offset to the financial exposure (netting agreement in place). In addition to the deals listed, I show the following deal numbers for KCS Resources: EN8202.1/.5, Q42270.1/.2, and V93274.1 (crude) all of which are physical deals. HPL is also doing business (purchases and sales) out of Resources. Plus all of the prompt month purchases (April deliveries wich we will pay next week and May gas).

"Here is the latest on this issue: On Monday, Austin Energy asked if they could take early title certain equipment (the foxbourgh equipment - sp?) in order to ""work around"" an internal budget issue. Apparently, if AE takes early title, they will be able to pay for the equipment (approx $440,000) from another fund and avoid the appearance of being over budget on the 4 LM project. Based upon my discussions with various internal groups, ENA is comfortable with either option #2 or option #3 below. See the tax response from Warren below. David Marshall is comfortable from an insurance perspective. Kay Mann (lawyer on GE breakout contract) confirmed in a voicemail that she did not anticipate the title transfer creating an issue with the warranties granted to ENA in the breakout agreement. Keenan phoned Chris Kirksey yesterday to relay the message that based upon preliminary discussions, we are comfortable with either approach. Next Steps: Jeffrey anticipates hearing from Chris today to get preliminary feedback on if Austin needs title (option #3) or if the ""acknowledgement letter"" (option #2) would suffice. Monday, December 4, there is an internal meeting to discuss the topic. Let me know if you have any thoughts or concerns.

"Russell, As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the summary.... ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of $3.74/mmbtu. It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in July 2001. City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index (physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002. They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you need for your analysis.

Below are the docs for review. The new funding vehicle will be named KSTAR VPP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (hoping I can shorten it to LP). I wanted to have your group in the loop because this WILL require a counterparty name change in the system. I am not sure of the effective date yet, but we will make it effective the 1st of the month. I asked legal why we have to change the name and they informed me that because of the financial structure of the deal, the banks want to know that this VPP is a newly formed entity with no prior business and no prior liabilities associated with it. From a financial perspective, all business activity before syndication is done as STAR VPP, LP and all business done after syndication will be done as KSTAR VPP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. Believe me, I wish we could avoid the name change, but there is no way around it. Once the contract details are fine tuned we can meet up on the process of the name change. I will keep you informed of further activity.

"Russell, As discussed, attached is the model for the City of Mesa deal. Here is the summary.... ENA is currently selling gas to the City of Mesa at a fixed price of $3.74/mmbtu. It is a 1 year deal that began in August of 2000 and expires in July 2001. City of Mesa wants to use the value in this contract to buy down an new index (physical delivery) deal that begins August 2001 and ends January 2002. They are willing to raise the price on the existing deal to about $4.50/mmbtu and use the value to discount the new floating index deal about $.30/mmbtu The summary page is the best place to start and probably has all the info you need for your analysis.

Neumin currently has the following 8 swaps and 1 option, Enron's credit group (Jay Williams) is proposing a partial unwind, which would be achieved by Booking a new ticket that is approximately $66 million out of the money to Enron (PV using LIBOR flat), and Booking an annuity (note receivable from Neumin) for this $66 million at 8.5%, which results in ~$85 million nominal over the term. So, Pushkar asked us to send you the change in nominal cash flow from this partial unwind. Attached is a file, which shows the nominal cash flow increase.

"Nathan, Charlie and I discussed this deal with the desk with the following results... Even though Darren Farmer mentioned on Friday that Lonestar is a pipe that runs through this county, there is no way he will be able to give you a 10 year fix price because he cannot secure a 10 transport rate from Lonestar. We would have to simply sell the gas at the delivery point at Lonestar's bid which he won't know unless you request. So, we looked at the next possibility which was Koch Midstream. This is extremely illiquid and the basis quote was $(.21) The NYMEX bid is about $3.62 So the all in bid is $3.41 I know these are not pretty, but it is the best we could do today.

The issue surrounded the expiration dates of the various legs of this trade, with confusion about whether those legs were to expire in December '01 or December '02. At the present, it is the general consensus of the Confirms/Origination teams that the legs in question (legs 2 & 4) should expire at the end of December '01. I say ""general consensus"" because we have no clear, concrete evidence that this expiration is correct.

On Friday, November 30, ENA will execute the purchase option and at that time own the 4 turbines for the Austin project. Hopefully, by the end of the week, ENA and GE will execute the breakout agreement which will ensure, primarily, that the GE warranties attached to the 4 Austin turbines are completely conveyed to ENA. Attached is the latest draft of the GE Breakout agreement between ENA and GE. In order to complete the breakout agreement, the lawyers need you guys to review section 10 regarding site specific performance guarantees and provide comments.

"Eric- I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific. Those changes are redlined. Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them. These were related to exhaust temperature and energy. I know this is a simple cycle plant and they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it anyway. It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined cycle. If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust guarantees. Let me know what they decide. Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to your file. (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.) I therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it. It is now attached as a separate word file. Exhibit F is ""boiler plate"" and shouldn't change. Exhibit ""U"" is not in my hard copy. My copy only goes up to Exhibit ""T."" If you get something from GE on Exhibit ""U"", send it to me and I will be glad to review it. If you have questions, give me a call.

"Eric, We need to get the physical gas delivery issue resolved.

The total volume for Dec.01 according to TW and my best determination at this time is 342,560 MMBtu which ENA has not scheduled reportedly because they do not have a counter-party that will transact. This gas volume and the resulting cash flow into ECS Compression Co. LLC is a large portion of the monthly cash flow required to fund the billing expenses. Gallup Sta. - 81,605 mmbtu's (Annual Charge Conversion) appears to be a $2.35/mmbtu price for this year 25,521 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge) appears to be a $2.44/mmbtu price for the term 107,126 mmbtu's for the month with a resulting $2.37144/mmbtu blended price Bloomfield - 110,240 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01) Bisti - 125,194 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01) 342,560 mmbtu's for the month of Dec. to ECS I'm not 100% sure of the pricing on these transactions but possibly with your information and Gerald Nemec's input we can determine and confirm.

"These are my notes on flowing gas. Tetco will be the problem pipeline. I called my rep again and asked her to seriously look into it. I'm thinking worse case is they will need either cash or a letter of credit for about $1,000,000.00. I'm using the following formula MDQ (22,000 dth) x 20 days x $ some cashout price They may cut back on the number of days but the cashout price is the problem. It's a moving target and I expect prices to go up. I think that if we just agreed to give them a letter of credit for $1 mill and then prepay for any actual expenses we incur, we could build our reputation on the pipeline, at least until we get rid of these deals. If all the gas flows like it should, we should never have any actual expenses on any of these pipelines for the Keyspan deal.

We are talking to him about the possibility of buying equity in the KCS deal. Specifically, they will buy Trust certificates that CIBC currently owns. The reason why this is important is that CIBC negotiated certain equity rights which effectively gives them veto rights over debt. CIBC is unwilling to give up their rights, so we are looking into the possibility of having HMC buy them out. HMC will not insist on having these rights. With this background in mind, I need your help to answer some of the following question with regards to KCS. Can you or Charlie go through the following questions and we can discuss them afterwards.

"Eric- I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific. Those changes are redlined. Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them. These were related to exhaust temperature and energy. I know this is a simple cycle plant and they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it anyway. It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined cycle. If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust guarantees. Let me know what they decide. Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to your file. (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.) I therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it. It is now attached as a separate word file. Exhibit F is ""boiler plate"" and shouldn't change. Exhibit ""U"" is not in my hard copy. My copy only goes up to Exhibit ""T."" If you get something from GE on Exhibit ""U"", send it to me and I will be glad to review it. If you have questions, give me a call.
