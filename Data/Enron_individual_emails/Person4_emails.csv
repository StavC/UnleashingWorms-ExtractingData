On page 17, in 2003-4, the DWR purchases $4.7B in power. The MOU states that SCE would be obligated for purchased power beginning in 2003. 2. On page 17, the debt service figure did not tie to the footnotes. Using both the $2.7B and $1.5B DWR note issuances, the annual debt service is approximately $430 mln per year on a mortgage type amortization and about $500 million per year on a straight-line amortization. The table indicates approximately $750 mln per year in debt service. Was the $3B SCE issue's debt service accidentally captured in these figures? 3. The SCE day one pre-tax sources appear to be : Bond issuance by SCE $3,000 mln Payment by parent $ 400 mln (at least) Sale of transmission $2,760 mln Total SCE inflows $6,160 mln What is needed is the model that shows that the original 4.9 cents covers cost of service and QF's, plus debt service, after these inflows reduce the current debt and past due vendors amounts.

"In its March 27 decisions, the CPUC granted a petition previously filed by The Utility Reform Network (TURN), a ratepayer advocacy group, that was opposed by SCE and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The CPUC directed that the balance in SCE's TRA, whether positive or negative, be transferred on a monthly basis to SCE's transition cost balancing account (TCBA), effective retroactively to January 1, 1998. The TRA is a regulatory asset account in which SCE records the difference between revenues received from customers through currently frozen rates and the costs of providing service to customers, including power procurement costs. The TCBA is a regulatory balancing account that tracks the recovery of generation-related transition costs, including stranded investments. The CPUC also ordered SCE to retroactively restate and record balances in its generation memorandum accounts to the TRA on a monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA. SCE believes that this decision by the CPUC is a fundamental departure from established regulatory accounting and ratemaking procedures and is unlawful and unconstitutional. SCE believes the CPUC's intent was to deny SCE lawful recovery of its costs and to artificially extend the end of the current rate freeze. The CPUC characterized the changes as merely reducing the prior revenues recorded in the TCBA, thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost recovery achieved to date. Based upon the transfer of balances into the TCBA, the CPUC stated that",michael.tribolet@enron.com,"jeff.dasovich@enron.com, wanda.curry@enron.com",,0,TURN accounting,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,michael.tribolet@enron.com
"All: Attached is the latest version. Note the average price of power assumed purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent for the 9.5 years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's forward price curves are used. We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in our sensitivity page. The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and DWR curves. Enron's curves are significantly lower on the back-end. The other switch is for the allocation of the past utility purchases: 1) one pro rata, and 2) one where the non-core shares prorata, plus half the core's portion. DWR past purchases are handled pro rata in both scenarios.

"FYI Credit Suisse First Boston <Paul_Patterson@xmr3.com> 01/25/2001 07:33 AM To: chip.schneider@enron.com cc: Subject: Governor Gives Limited Information on Auction Credit Suisse First Boston Paul Patterson Good morning, Here are some of the recent developments in the California power crisis: ? Yesterday evening, Governor Davis revealed preliminary results of the DWR's auction for long-term forward power contracts. 39 bidders participated, with an average weighted bid of $0.069 per kWh excluding ""Super Peak"" periods. ? However, the governor did not discuss the quantity of power actually bid, the breakdown between offers for base-load, peak, and off-peak power, or provisions for ancillary services. In our opinion, these are exceedingly important issues that need to be known to adequately determine the ""success"" of any auction. ? Republican Assembly leader Bill Campbell is reportedly working on an alternative bill to Speaker Hertzberg's proposed bill. Reportedly Campbell's bill would call for the state to arrange long-term contracts for the utilities, in exchange for the option to purchase ownership stakes. ? We believe that the actual results of the long-term contract auctions should be a key point of focus for investors and may help determine what headroom, if any, the utilities could have. We believe that investors should remain aware of the high risk still associated with shares of PCG ($9.94, Hold) and EIX ($9.63, Hold).

I have had a chance to overlay this PWC projection of PG&E's revenue requirement to cover retained generation, QF and bilaterals, an estimate of the undercollection and the DWR revenue requirement to analyze the sufficiency (headroom) in current rates. Note, there is a outstanding rate case on the generation component of rates for the IOU's. I included three sections below. The first illustrates that unevenness of DWR's cash needs. The second displays the costs across all sales volumes. The third displays unit costs based on PG&E and DWR's revenue flows and their volumes provided.

"------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Power juggling ramped up price Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur, Chronicle Staff Writers Sunday, May 20, 2001 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages, according to dozens of interviews with regulators, lawyers and energy industry workers. Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices",michael.tribolet@enron.com,"richard.shapiro@enron.com, james.steffes@enron.com,

"Here is the PG&E 10-K disclosure, which does not help much. Under AB 1890, when the Utility has recovered its eligible transition costs, the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the transition period will have been satisfied. At August 31, 2000, consistent with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC, the Utility credited its TCBA by $2.1 billion, the amount by which a negotiated $2.8 billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book value of such assets. Based on this credit, the Utility believes it recovered its eligible transition costs during August 2000. At August 31, 2000, there was a balance of approximately $2.2 billion of undercollected wholesale power costs recorded in the TRA. If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets is greater than $2.8 billion, as the Utility expects, the Utility believes it will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May 2000. The undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition period will be less than the $2.2 billion August 31, 2000 balance and could be zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when the transition period actually ends. Under current CPUC decisions and AB 1890, the Utility's customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs after the Utility has recovered its transition costs. In one of its March 27, 2001 decisions, the CPUC adopted TURN's proposal to transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utility's TRA to the utility's TCBA",michael.tribolet@enron.com,jennifer.thome@enron.com,,0,RE: California Rate Exposure,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,sent,michael.tribolet@enron.com

"All: Attached is the latest version. Note the average price of power assumed purchased by the DWR, if smoothed to a fixed price equivalent for the 9.5 years beginning 7/1/01, is $106/mwh and $104/mwh if DWR's forward price curves are used. We used a range of $82.75 to $104/mwh in our sensitivity page. The $82.75 is the mid-point between Henwood and DWR curves. Enron's curves are significantly lower on the back-end. The other switch is for the allocation of the past utility purchases: 1) one pro rata, and 2) one where the non-core shares prorata, plus half the core's portion. DWR past purchases are handled pro rata in both scenarios.

We ask that EES and EEMC be allowed to: ""seek(ing) the restoration of the cumulative unpaid credit balances which previously were present on bills to EES and EEMC rendered by PG&E; and 2) to permit EES and EEMC to deposit monies representing the amount of disputed bills from PG&E with the CPUC pursuant to Rules 10 and 22 of PG&E's applicable tariff."" Our PX credits were removed from the bills late last year. We have been billed by PG&E for the positive PX credit which is accruing now that we have put customers back on direct access and the ""market price"" has fallen below the generation portion of the tarriff. We are asserting a recoupment argument. The recoupment is ostensibly an offset against amounts which we are owed (negative PX credit). Persuing this offset essentially liquidates the claim we are owed at 100 cents. -----Original Message----- From: CARL EKLUND [mailto:CEKLUND@LLGM.COM] Sent: Thursday, September 06, 2001 6:06 PM To: Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Williams, Robert C.; mday@gmssr.com Cc: Charles Ferguson; John Klauberg; Sanford Kingsley Subject: Motion for Relief from Stay The Memorandum and Motion for Relief from Stay and other appropriate pleadings for relief from PG&E were filed",michael.tribolet@enron.com,"j..kean@enron.com, d..steffes@enron.com, richard.shapiro@enron.com,

Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent System Operator.

"Spoke with Ben Glisan re our conversation on retail credit and concluded that we should meet with some banks that specialize in this area. Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website?? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D. and proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.
